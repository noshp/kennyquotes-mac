Does this mean Sonal defaults on todays challenge?
because I have 7 client projects and 1 internal project active at the same time
my work has a paid zapier account...
Salesforce had metal detectors and sniffer dogs... so probably can't bring a flask
Does Overwatch raise heart rate?
saved my ass a couple of times
when we reach $100 we go drinking
I don't believe in fitness goals
shit nvm, I'm going to a "buying a used motorcycle" workshop at 7pm around Ossington
we're meeting on Wellesley st. no?
Or, I can rent a car and we can also ask Wilfrid.... So it'd be me, Alex, Sonal and Wilfrid
we meeting in front of Wellesley at 5? <@U18VAQPB9>
How would you take a photo that proves sustained intentional calorie burning exercise over a duration of time?
Why the fuck is Elon stalking my messages
find a girlfriend for sonal
you get 5 shrute dollars for every task
Google keep Todo lists
Shit I'm feeling it right now just looking at that picture
drink less
what bit torrent client do y'all use?
Sonal and I are in Mississauga right now. Probably will head home and sleep next.
Then we'll move on to lesser and gradually more degenerate drinking holes
who the fuck is this imposter
Wait till Sunday so Sonal can come
Alright you guys are buying drinks next time for this roasting
Google Docs. I have a chrome extension that starts a new Google doc in one click
Going to Salesforce
Can do it on overwatch
oh shit right
I just click it whenever I start a meeting to start a new meeting minutes document
so I can pretend to be on a client call and not have to eat lunch with my coworkers
Otherwise we do it on overwatch
cause i got that shit down
I'm just glad the weeks over and the weekend has begun. Tiring being in front of client the entire week.
google doc?
Ken is coming out
cold calls with fake enthusiasm and interest in the client
so Alex and Sonal could partner and deliver the training. I may invite a few co-workers (so please don't embarass me). Thinking we can do Sunday.
Alex you can be a one-day subcontracted trainer of Sonal Development Corp
if it's "training" delivered by "industry professionals" I can invoice Grantbook for it and get it reimbursed
which means we can access all our past messages and archive them somewhere, like google sheets
it's on a whole different scale compared to Google Cloud
if it's anything like Salesforce dreamtour, it should have swag, food and open bar
Sonal come over if you want to hitch a ride

If Zaikushi does that lame ass birthday song and cake I'll murder someone
Discovering /r/lotrmemes and drinking at the airport is the best way to handle flight delays
Fuck Porter
And fuck downtown for having a nightime flight curfew
shit i dun have an umbrella
Haven't had any issues; bout the same as dropbox and google drive.
but see <@U1XRS5MCM>, mac carries my drunk ass lovingly
At Track and Fielf, 5 drinks in. Antler will be interesting.
laura uses the same toilet
and it's not like his own code is perfect, shit was swiss cheese
nah, overwatch tonight
I'm quitting slack now before all client presentations and demos
Yay for 90 minute meetings that were 85 min too long.
yes, instead of paying for Pivotal Tracker, we're going to recreate the functionality using Google Sheets and Toggl hour logs
ahhhhh I can't leave work when on site with client until 5 pm &gt;_&gt;
I'm meeting with my boss to discuss what it could look like; maybe every other week in NYC for 6 months
Just don't drink alcohol to help, because your tolerance will never be able to keep up with how awkward you perceive yourself.
Clients who hire a non-tech savvy grants admin, who is their sole database admin, but can't work their way around a spreadsheet/pivot table
also, people who submit generic resumes and job applications, fuck off
when you get mad at someone's shitty job configuring zapier
other key performance indicator being if the project met the overall strategic goal makes sense
Ew Salesforce
I saw Naina today here at Salesforce <@U18VAQPB9>. From  crispiest chip in the bag fame.
So where we drinking
drinking at home then
Hey Kenny. I know your busy, but I want to bring a dead project back to life (internal wiki), which we've previously tried to tackle but ended up dropping every time due to resourcing. Can I schedule *a few hours* in your calendar this week to talk about it?
Also, can you book a few hours in Anthony's calendar this week to train him, and then do it again in January since he's only coming in this week and leaving on vacation next week until January.
Yeah I'm just going to put the events in the calendar then cancel it 5 min prior to start
Go to the gym on campus. Exercise helps
sonal loves that shit
set a goal and do it
Get it in the calendar
The awardee used to work at Fluxx, now works at a Fluxx major client
GOOGLE SHEETS CONNECTOR FTW BITCH
Because I'm not a client (Ford Foundation)
Spending one hour at all-staff meeting to propose joining an affiliate group / justifying the $1200 membership fee.
and I'd make it a deliberate task to do so
That's usually the platform we use with enterprise/security-minded clients
they just gotta send Sonal down with a scale to measure pigs on a daily basis for 90 days
3 am last night, but only because I have a deadline and caught a flow state after playing overwatch
Client going live next Monday. Need to validate today.
